// Per-ENTRY list of door gameobjects that are SCRIPT-ONLY: the live client
// refuses a direct player open and ONLY an in-game event opens them, even though
// their template (an empty lock-85, the same template as plenty of plainly
// clickable doors) reads as openable to DoorOpenerFor / DcDoorPolicy.
// A bot generic-Use()ing one of these toggles the server GO state while the
// client still treats the door as shut — a desync — and it also skips the
// intended event (e.g. Shadowfang Keep's courtyard door, which only opens when a
// freed prisoner walks over and unlocks it).
//
// This is DELIBERATELY keyed by GO ENTRY, not by lock id: lock 85 is shared with
// many doors bots SHOULD open (Deadmines Factory/Foundry/Mast Room, etc.), so a
// lock-level rule would break them. Keep this list to doors verified to be
// script/event-opened only; the door-blocked action consults it before deciding
// it is "entitled" to open a door, and leaves a listed door for the events
// framework or the human instead.

    // instance-script GO-state control.

    // Keyed by GO ENTRY, not by lock id, for the same reason as the lists

    // gates and the Stratholme Scarlet-side doors), so only an entry list can
    // name one door without naming another that happens to share its lock.
    //
    // The same argument extends to Dire Maul North, Scholomance and Stratholme

    // is a farmed item, not an encounter lock. Each was verified in the world
    // DB before being listed, against the checklist this list demands:
    //
    //   * GAMEOBJECT_TYPE_DOOR with a real lock whose only slots are a key item
    //     and/or lockpicking — never a lock-free script seal (see the
    //     IsLockFreeClickable note for why lock-free is the dangerous shape).
    //   * gameobject_template_addon.flags == 34 (GO_FLAG_LOCKED | NODESPAWN):
    //     no GO_FLAG_NOT_SELECTABLE and no GO_FLAG_INTERACT_COND, so a player
    //     at the keyboard really can click them. (GO_FLAG_LOCKED is exactly
    //     what DcDoorPolicy suppresses bare-hands opening on: only the key
    //     or the lockpicking opens them.)
    //   * No ScriptName. Where an AIName exists it is SmartGameObjectAI whose
    //     only action is a gossip-hello SET_INST_DATA recording wing progress —
    //     and GameObject::Use() runs that GossipHello BEFORE the lock check, so
    //     the door-blocked action's Use() drives the identical sequence a keyed
    //     player does. Nothing is skipped or desynced.
    //   * The instance script, where it mentions the door at all, only calls
    //     AllowSaveToDB(true) on it (instance_stratholme / instance_scholomance)
    //     so a player-opened gate persists across a relog. It never reads or
