// Internal registration seam for the per-dungeon event tables.
//
// Each dungeon owns one .cpp in this folder that defines its event rows
// (Register<Dungeon>Events). A Conditional event's activation predicate is a
// free function defined in the SAME file, handed to the builder by pointer
// (.Conditional(&MyPredicate)) — there is no separate condition registry and no
// global id space to keep collision-free. The central DungeonEventRegistry calls
// the Register<Dungeon>Events aggregators EXPLICITLY so every per-dungeon
// translation unit stays referenced.
//
// Why explicit calls and not self-registering static initializers: the module
// compiles into a static lib, and a TU whose only output is constructor
// side-effects (with no symbol the program references) is dropped by the linker
// — its events would silently vanish. The one-big-table this replaces avoided
// that by keeping everything in a single referenced TU; the aggregator calls
// below restore the reference chain per file. (Same reason ObjectiveHookRegistry
// and friends use hardcoded tables.)
//
// Adding a dungeon:
//   1. Create <Dungeon>Events.cpp here.
//   2. Define Register<Dungeon>Events; for any Conditional event, define its
//      predicate as a static free function in that file and pass &Predicate to
//      .Conditional() (a typo is a compile error, not a silent never-fire).
//   3. Declare the appender below.
//   4. Add the call in EventTable() (DungeonEventRegistry.cpp).
//   5. If the dungeon corrects the auto-derived boss list, define its roster
//      patch as Register<Dungeon>Roster in the SAME file (using the DcRoster
//      builders in DungeonRosterBuilders.h), declare it below, and add the call
//      in PatchTable() (BossRosterRegistry.cpp). One file owns all of a
//      dungeon's clear data: event rows + conditions + roster patch.

// Shared, cross-dungeon activation predicate — external linkage so several
// dungeon files can pass &DcRoomAggroPreClearCondition to .Conditional().
// DUE while the room-trash value still has anything to clear (every
// RoomAggroRegistry boss: SM Cathedral, Scholomance Marduk & Vectus, ...).

// box, its route slice and the point it ends at need exactly ONE definition, and
// the probe suite re-derives them against the real mesh.
//
// NO ROSTER PATCH, and that is worth writing down rather than leaving as an
// absence. All four of map 602's instance_encounters rows are creditType 0
// (ENCOUNTER_CREDIT_KILL_CREATURE) against real `creature` spawns, and
// DungeonEncounter.dbc's order (Bjarngrim 0, Volkhan 1000, Ionar 2000, Loken
// 3000) IS the walking order — so BossSpawnIndex::Build derives the whole list
// with correct coordinates on both difficulties. This is the first WotLK map in
// the module where that is true; the previous four (Halls of Stone, Drak'Tharon,
// Gundrak, The Nexus) each needed a patch to be runnable at all. Do not add one
// here: the transit below is a CONDITIONAL event, which needs no roster row, no
// order keys and no OBJ() anchor, and a patch could only make things worse.
//
// DIFFICULTY TWINS ARE STAT TEMPLATES, NOT ENTRIES. Almost every creature on
// this map has one (Slag 28585 -> 30970, Volkhan 28587 -> 31536, ...), and
// Creature::InitEntry resolves DifficultyEntry[diff-1] into m_creatureInfo and
// then does SetEntry(Entry) — "normal entry always" — so GetEntry() returns the
// NORMAL id on heroic. Every entry-keyed constant below is the normal id and is
// correct on both difficulties. Do not add the 30xxx/31xxx ids anywhere.
//
// EVERY COORDINATE HERE IS COLUMN-PROBED against the live 602 mmtiles
// (t/TestHallsOfLightningRouteProbe), and on this map that is not ceremony. The
// mmtiles carry flat sheets far below the dungeon — a continuous surface at
// z ~ -1.9 and another at z ~ -13.9 under essentially the whole footprint — so
// map 602 is in the flat-grid-height family ([[ac-map601-flat-gridheight-zero]])
// and an anchor authored from a script literal rather than from the probed TOP
// surface is a sink waiting to happen. The open centre of Bjarngrim's ring
// (1330, 30) has NO dungeon floor at all: probing it returns 143.02, -1.88,
// -13.88, so a hold point or camp placed there drops a bot 45-55yd.

    //      every poly below z 40 removed returns NO PATH from Bjarngrim's floor
    //      to Volkhan. The party must descend 17yd from the hall's south arm
    //      (z 40.7 -> z 23.9), walk ~110yd south along the pit floor, climb the
    //      far wall to the mid ledge (z 38.6) and climb again to the gallery
    //      (z 52.7) — 395yd of route for 80yd of straight line. There is no
    //      upper gallery route.
    //   2. FOURTEEN SLAG (28585) LINE THE WALKWAY ON A TWENTY-SECOND RESPAWN
    //      (`creature.spawntimesecs = 20`, MovementType 1, wander_distance 8 —
    //      the shortest respawn on any map this module runs). Twelve of the
    //      fourteen are within 20yd of the route line in 2D; with the wander all
    //      fourteen reach it, and level 79 against level 80 is inside base aggro
    //      range for the whole walk.
    //   3. SO THE CLEAR HAS NO DRIVER IN THERE. DcCombatFlag::MayDrive is false
    //      while anything in the party is engaged and Advance is registered only
    //      in the NON-combat engine, so party engagement never drops for the
    //      no-engage grace window. The leg is not slow; it is stopped. This is
    //      Blackwing Lair's Suppression Rooms one tier down.

    // AND KILLING THEM IS NEGATIVE PROGRESS, which is why the answer is a
    // transit and not a clear. Each Slag is 15 828 HP with DamageModifier 1 —
    // trivial, harmless in melee — but smart_scripts 28585 id 1/3 is
    // `On Just Died -> Blast Wave` (23113 normal / 22424 heroic): 10yd, and

// DcHallsOfLightning and DcVioletHold are: several are SAFETY numbers whose
// whole value is that a test can re-derive them from live data, and a literal
// buried in a .cpp cannot be pinned.
//
// EVERY COORDINATE BELOW IS ROUTED OR COLUMN-PROBED against the live map-575
// mmtiles (t/TestUtgardePinnacleRouteProbe). Map 575 is NOT in the
// flat-grid-height family ([[ac-map601-flat-gridheight-zero]]) — every fixed
// point snaps with d2d 0.00 and dz between +0.0 and +0.5, and the only larger
// deltas are the two portcullis ORIGINS (+3.92, +1.83), which is ordinary: a
// door origin sits below its own threshold.
//
// THE ONE THING TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT THIS DUNGEON. It does not have a door
// problem; it has a ONE-ROW ROSTER problem, and the door stall is the
// second-order symptom. instance_encounters credits Svala at entry 26668, which
// has NO SPAWN ROW ANYWHERE IN THE DB — boss_svala.cpp does
// me->UpdateEntry(NPC_SVALA_SORROWGRAVE) ~34s into the intro cinematic, so the
// entry only exists at runtime. BossSpawnIndex::Build joins creditEntry ->
// creature spawn row, matches nothing, and drops the first boss SILENTLY. The
// derived roster is 3 bosses for a 4-boss dungeon.
//
// That single missing row is what walked tr-20260902-083808-1 into two shut
// portcullises: with Svala gone the clear's first target is Palehoof, and the
// navmesh — baked DOOR-BLIND — offers a 696yd shortcut to him that threads BOTH
// gates. The designed first leg to Svala is 362 + 101yd and threads NEITHER.
// See [[dc-credit-entry-is-an-updateentry-target]] and the roster patch in
// UtgardePinnacleEvents.cpp.
//
// DIFFICULTY TWINS ARE STAT TEMPLATES, NOT ENTRIES, exactly as on map 602:
// Creature::InitEntry resolves DifficultyEntry[diff-1] into m_creatureInfo and
// then SetEntry(Entry), so GetEntry() returns the NORMAL id on heroic. Every
// entry-keyed constant here is the normal id and is correct on both
// difficulties. Do not add the 307xx/308xx heroic clones anywhere.
//
// AND SVALA IS DBC BIT 0 ON BOTH DIFFICULTIES (rows 577/578), unlike Gundrak
// and the Nexus — so ONE Any-gated roster patch serves normal and heroic, and
// the DBC order (Svala 0, Palehoof 1000, Skadi 2000, Ymiron 3000) IS the travel

    // Opcode, which re-tests Player::IsInAreaTriggerRadius(atEntry, 0.f). For a

    // to be physically inside the box.

    // WHICH MAKES THE ARRIVE RADIUS A CONTAINMENT RADIUS, not a tolerance. Both
    // the objective's arrival trigger (DungeonClearTriggers.cpp) and the event's
    // leading MoveTo step (DungeonEventExecutor::RunStep) latch on
    // GetExactDist(anchor) <= arriveRadius and then STOP the tank. An arrive

    // the raid somewhere else.
    //
    // It exists because of what the ordinary pipeline does the moment Grethok's
    // anchor clears: the next boss becomes Razorgore, and Razorgore — possessed,
    // being driven egg to egg by our own runner — is a MOVING anchor. The advance
    // then does exactly what it does for any wandering boss: it re-paths at his
    // live position every few seconds and holds at the engage range, and the
    // followers, who follow the tank, come with it. Measured on the first live
    // run of the egg phase (23:14:41 and 23:15:47, 45yd and 42yd splines issued
    // at the possessed boss, interleaved with "within engage range of Razorgore
    // the Untamed (25yd/27yd/11yd/23yd/17yd) -> holding for at-boss"): the raid

    // (DungeonClearRazorgoreCampTrigger), which holds inside the leash and walks
    // a drifted bot back to its near edge.

// hands the tick back to the plain garrison, and lets that add walk to Brann —
// whose death is the encounter's only fail condition and restarts the entire
// escort. It must also stay EXCLUSIVE of the three heads, which are probed
// separately (they exist for the WHOLE fight, including the quiet first 52
// seconds, and are what arms the driver before any add has spawned).
//
// NORMAL ENTRIES ONLY, on both difficulties — see the difficulty-twin note in
// namespace DcHallsOfStone for why adding 31876/31877/31380 would be dead weight.
